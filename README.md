# Plotly_HW

## Belly Button Biodiversity

- Using the dataset from rubdunnlab, an interactive dashboard was built to display the results of data showing different microbes in sample navels

- Using Plotly, both pie and scatter plots were made to display the amount of presence of top 10 microbes in the navel

-A Heroku app varsha-plotly-hw was created and connected to this Github repository, allowing automatic deploys from the master branch
